I"¨<p>After reading one of my 2019 favourite books, <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/tinyml/9781492052036/">â€˜TinyML: Machine Learning with TensorFlow Lite on Arduino and Ultra-Low-Power Microcontrollersâ€™</a> by <em>Daniel Situnayake</em> and <em>Pete Warden</em>. I decided to build a TinyML project for my final Capstone at Institute of Data, where I later got hired to the Data Science Training Team instantly after presenting the Speech Recognition project. In this post, Iâ€™ll introduce the concept of TinyML, why it is a giant opportunity as well as sharing step-by-step guide to build yourself a personal TinyML Speech Recognition Virtual Assistant.</p>
